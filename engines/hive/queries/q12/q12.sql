ORDER BY wcs_user_sk
--CLUSTER BY instead of ORDER BY does not work to achieve global ordering. e.g. 2 reducers: first reducer will write keys 0,2,4,6.. into file 000000_0 and reducer 2 will write keys 1,3,5,7,.. into file 000000_1.concatenating these files does not produces a deterministic result if number of reducer changes.
--Solution: parallel "order by" as non parallel version only uses a single reducer and we cant use "limit"
